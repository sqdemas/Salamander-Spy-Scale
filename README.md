# Salamander-Spy-Scale

## **Pitch** 

It is an infinite runner style game, with a Salamander scaling up a building in attempt to collect 
pages while dodging bombs.

---
## **About** 

Players will maneuver the SuperSpy Salamander left and right with the arrow keys to collect pages of classified 
documents while dodging bombs. The Salamander loses a heart each time he is hit with a bomb and when all 
three hearts are lost, the game will end. When the game is over, the user can choose to quit or play again. 
There will be a settings tab in the corner allowing players to adjust difficulty between easy, medium, and hard.
